        <p>I struggle greatly with pinning down my personality. In many ways I find that indeterminacy wonderfully empowering, but I also think it is practically useful to describe what to expect when interacting with me. Most people will experience me as introverted, apprehensive, and passive. I have a lot of ideas floating around in my head, but frequently struggle to put them to words, and even more frequently do not even attempt. However, if I feel comfy around you I can really open up to be a passionate person. I tend to enjoy the company of individuals who have strong personalities, but struggle with groups of people.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-hr">Things I Like</h3>
        <p><strong>Books.</strong> I love all sorts of topics, but my interests are broadly around political and social theory. See <a href="/politics.html">politics page</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134795132-kyler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoodReads</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Anime/Manga.</strong> Some of my favorite genres are psychological, mystery, and romance. See <a href="https://anilist.co/user/ManiacKyler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anilist</a>.</p> 
        <p><strong>YouTube.</strong> I basically always have a tab playing while I do anything, whether it be music, lectures, or just fluff content.</p>
        <p><strong>Video Games.</strong> I used to be very dedicated to Overwatch; I played on teams and climbed the ranked ladder well into the top 1% of players. Now I play all sorts of games casually. See <a href="/gaming.html">gaming page</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> Hanging out on Discord with friends, attending <a href="/school.html">club meetings</a>, running, <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014DEWE01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cubing</a>.</p>
