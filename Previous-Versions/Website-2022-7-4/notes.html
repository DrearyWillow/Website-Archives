To Do List:

center nav-bar
nav-bar specific css (not just ul + li)
mess around with body width and margins (consider mobile)
"other games" list is sloppy
image varying with screen size
different link within the page as you scroll down (like anarchist library chapters) so i could link to kyler.neocities.org/politics#youth-liberation for ex.
scroll-content: smooth
role="region"
aria-labelledby=""
