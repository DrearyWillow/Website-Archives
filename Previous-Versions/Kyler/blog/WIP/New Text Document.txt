On Cultural and Intellectual Isolation

actually i was right about otaku-ness (in some ways)
lack integrated knowledge
probably greatly due to lack of friends, self confidence, willingness to discuss/characterize a view presented, passive consumption rather than inspired to creation
social aspect just missing, and thats big part of properly contextualizing, understanding, creating, and exposure to new things and more wholistic picture
intellectual and cultural loneliness
skeptical of others interpretations
