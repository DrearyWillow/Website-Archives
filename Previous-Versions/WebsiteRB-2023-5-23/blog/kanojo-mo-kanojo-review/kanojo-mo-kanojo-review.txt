Needs More Gay

Representation Cool (I am a liberal now)

Male Gaze

"Fairness", "Equality", and other ideological delusions

Allonormativity and Amatonormativity

Possessiveness and Competition

Artificial Scarcity

So Much Potential

Some Good Moments!
- challenge absolute subservience approach of Naoya in episode 4
- challenge Nagisa seeing herself as second best
- little short thing with Saki's mom supporting her sexuality

Rika
- Rika's dad (and minimal pushback)
