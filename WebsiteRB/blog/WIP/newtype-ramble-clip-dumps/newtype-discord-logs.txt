oh yea i launched discord to say
im still watching cloud's clipdumps and id really like to see an academic article on clip dumps
idk from what discipline bc it covers so much
idk prolly like some cultural anthropology thing or something
its just really interesting bc theres this aspect of technology where people have access to video editing software and the format is simple enough (stitch clips back to back, add song)
but then theres also a ton that goes into song choice right
and theres this other thing of like the little jokes that are included at the end
its not just like showing off or whatever, people like to do it as a creative outlet and to like have some determinate thing after their days of grinding, fun things to look back on, things to send and share with friends
like its this massive culturally important thing with relatively low barrier to entry and idk
just really heartwarming
not to mention how the platform of youtube influences things
unlisted vs public, posting on twitter
people give all sorts of different significance with all sorts of different compmlexities
and thats not even mentioning the types of interpretations or significance it has for viewers
and "intended audience" vs not and how that influences
like for me these are functioning quite differently than active players, much less active dps players
watching clip dumps and games and videos of tank players is unbelievably different than dps yknow
also what kind of clips are chose and what that communicates too
like even "pop off" clips are vastly different
and communicate so much about playstlyle and personality and what they consider impressive
theres so much i really really really adore this stuff
also the fact that theres somehwat of a barrier to entry right
like i would not understand a rainbow 6 clip dump yknow
the clips are vy definition quick so you have to rapidly get acusstomed to the game state and recognize why a clip was good enough to be included
btw on the different games aspect plenty of people have dumps with multiple games and thats just a whole another layer
i didnt talk enough about music either, that also communicates so much
its likie such an intimate and personal creation
music: personality: popoularity, taste, the whole vibe of the video 
not to mention! the intercommunity dynamic right
like what types of music are popular in general and what types of music are popular within the specific community and demographic
and deliberately deviating or variating or picking something less popular
or avoiding picking a track that someone in the community just recently chose
or alternatively not heeding any of that
music is very importatnt bc the song choice basically mediates the tone of the clips (not intrinsically because receiving person has choice of volume
thats the other thing! being hosted consistently on youtube means they can be accessed at any time any place on a variety of devices and that radically changes things as well
no where near the same experience if you are watching on your gaming rig that you also play overwatch on vs on a phone where sometimes it can be difficult to see whats going on 
being able to rewind, rewatch
watch in playlist, watch as subscription intermittently, bingable
being sent private links
also channel layout influences everything too like description, pfp, banner, about section
also hero pool of the person!
i should really write this up in blog post lol
its a lil goofy but i like it
less of like "i have a lot of determinate ideas and opinions about this but more like "i have so many things going through my mind while this is happening
and also like this is not an infrequent thing i get with cultural things
and ig just good illustrator of that thought process
oh! also like variation between videoslike something might stand out because its unique from this person
also progression over time
in terms of taste, personality, getting better at the game
so many differences
also major milestones both personal and more structural
like game updating, meta changing, joining a team so more scrim clips
also the whole hiding smurf killfeed with blur is cute lol
and that ties in with whole other thing like smurfs!
idk i think this is just very lateral thinking
also pretty impressionistic if were sticking with neurotyping bc im just sort of pointing at things and being like look! these are types of things that are significant but i can't fully flesh them out myself with words
my blog post is gonna include a lukacs quote about totality and hegel lol
bc unironically its tru
ok i think im mostly done for now lol
i made notion note about website so were chillin
oh yea tournament clips! and caster stuff
also re:playstyle is like aiming style too, plus sensitivity and that is informative as well
different associations evoked when thinking about a kovaaks grinder or vertical flicks or more tracking 
and hero pool choice as well and when differing
oh! also choices about maps
sometimes people have maps theyre really good on or include a lof clips from
also within videos sometimes people choose clips from the same game where they were really feeling it vs across a bunch of different games
also long clips vs short flashy things
also considering the absence
what type of player might someone might be to not upload and what does that look like
could be just simple lack of interest but could also indicate certain playstle (being more team oriented, less obviously flashy hero pool, different types of personality, less community oriented, more casual, less casual, so much)
oh and length of video right
finding clips to match song or vice versa
i feel like im trying to do a lot of things here that im not completely qualified to do like hermeneutics and phenomology and sociology and anthropology and technology but more than anything i just want to point people to think about things in that way 
less than me actually instructing someone and more me just sharing how i look at the world sometimes
oh also the dynamic of youtube and that framing, i.e. comparing to other overwatch content and how that reciporacally influences
also with the unqualification component, yknow im kinda slightly alienated from the type of people that makethe vids as well as the ow community in general
plus only familiar with ow as game
ive got limitations but i still think its extremely valuable
OH! and specifically about description: do they link socials? discord? song?
also recording method too like some people use that nvidia thing, some ppl take stream clips, some ppl take in game clips, some replays, some just record their game specifically for this purpose
also the extent to which other people play a role in the video
thats broad and nonspecific but it can be so many ways
do they have lots of friends they play with? duo? are they talking? dming? what does the chat look like? do they emphasize peoples reactions to their plays (from chat, on call, streamer reactions, tourney casters, etc)?
also do they completely mute clips and when do they selectively enable sound (dinks, funny jokes, comments from teammates, sometimes audio bits from other sources overlayed on the clip)
idk maybe it seems like im just naming all the things i can think of but genuinely i feel like you could unironically unravel so so much just just this small thing
like if i wanted i could start with being qua being or the commodity form and unfold everything out from there and i feel the same with this yknow
(well yknow, i couldnt do that lol)
oh yea! game setttings or other computer settings or other programs that are open
before ow2 arround level and rank
sometimes ppl include qp clips or other things too
interesting for lots of reasons
type of person to not exclusively play comp in the first place but then also including it in video and for what purpose
oh yea also when they cut off the clip
like sometimes its clear theyre gonna die in the clip but they cut it
and sometimes they let it play out
which is why its hard to know where to go with it yknow
easily could be long chapter about masculinity or overwatch history or changes in contemporary social relationships, use of technology, etcetc
think im fr done now tho lol
oh and on the comparability like what differentiates between meme vids, montages especially, rank progression, themed vids (like trying to tell a story/narrative structure)
